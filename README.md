**Springboot based Full-Fledged Robust Enteprise Level Automation Framework**

Work In Progress*

The key objective behind this project is to design a robust Automation Test Framework that would support test automation at all levels, including, but not limited to UI (Presentation Layer), APIs & Integration (Service Layer), and Unit/Components, etc. The framework supports various Test Data, Test Environment, Configuration Management, and Test Automation features which are needed to run any modern automated tests.

**Features:**
• Context and Dependency Injection using Spring.
• Supports data insertion in all types of DB's like MongoDB, SQL DB, Excel, CSV, etc using Spring JPA.
• Inbuilt Test Data Generation features using Faker & Fixture libraries for supplying Test Data in respective tests.
• Rest Assured support for API testing and PACT for running Contract tests.
• Supports all kinds of projects including Data & Keyword-driven along with Page Object Model with PageFactory.
• Infrastructure support for Dockerized Selenium Grid containers.
• Support for Parallel testing with Cross-Browser and Cross-Platform support. (Used Browserstack as an example, but the same example can be used for any other type of Cloud Testing platforms like LambdaTest or Applitools.
• Custom scopes for running Webdriver thread.
• Visual assertions support using Shutterbug library.
