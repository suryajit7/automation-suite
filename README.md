**Features:**
1. Context and Dependency Injection using Spring.
2. Supports data insertion in all types of DB's like MongoDB, SQL DB, Excel, CSV, etc using Spring JPA.
3. Inbuilt Test Data Generation features using Faker & Fixture libraries for supplying Test Data in respective tests.
4. Rest Assured support for API testing and PACT for running Contract tests.
5. Supports all kinds of projects including Data & Keyword-driven along with Page Object Model with PageFactory.
6. Infrastructure support for Dockerized Selenium Grid containers.
7. Support for Parallel testing with Cross-Browser and Cross-Platform support. (Used Browserstack as an example, but the same example can be used for any other type of Cloud Testing platforms like LambdaTest or Applitools.
8. Custom scopes for running Webdriver thread.
9. Visual assertions support using Shutterbug library.
